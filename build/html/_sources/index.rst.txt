The Monitoring Integrated System for Land Degradation MISLAND was developed under 
The Monitoring Integrated System for Land Degradation MISLAND was developed under 
GMES & Africa programme through a collaboration between the OSS and LocateIT  as a Decision Support System (DSS) utilizing Earth Observation data to deliver information, promote awareness, and support decision making toward achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) in African countries. 

At the very core, the service provides information to monitor SDG indicator 15.3.1 
(Proportion of land that is degraded over the total land area). In addition, and to 
improve the understanding and the multi-faceted nature of the active processes 
behind land degradation, MISLAND service also provides information on vegetation 
loss and gain hotspots, forest change, forest fires and the Mediterranean Desertification 
and Land Use Model (MEDALUS), to assess desertification indicators.
